### Hi there 👋
I am passionate about computer security aka cybersecurity, especially the offensive part 😈, a few years ago I 
was very interested in the world of Machine Learning/Deep Learning, in short, Artificial Intelligence 🧠 and 
now I love to combine it with the field of cybersecurity 🔐 to create projects, investigate new algorithms 🧮 
that can be applied in the sector or develop innovative tools 🛠️. I'm currently very involved in the analysis of 
vulnerabilities in web applications 🐞, preparing the AWAE certification offered by Offensive-Security and 
making machines on the HackTheBox 🟩 platform to keep up to date on the different vulnerabilities. ![Top
